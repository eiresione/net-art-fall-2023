        Interpersonal Instances Online
    </p>
    <p>Social experiences and their subsequent emotional consequences long reigned as topics of 
    literature and art. Now they are pushed into the online world, where they can be visited by anyone, 
    anytime, granting a new set of interactions with expressions of human connection. Universal love, friendship, 
    romance, or the many other forms of relationships we live through speak to the complexity that exists between 
    each one of us, albeit most of the time it is invisible. Social interconnection is not so easily contained, 
    however. We seek to immortalize our social lives and our reactions to them in our creations.</p>

  <p>  This exhibition serves to highlight works on interpersonal attachment, or means of exploring the metaphorical 
    space between people. In other words, projects centered on human connection, presented online. The following 
    net artworks feature exploration of the nature of relationships and their translations to the digital world, 
    as well as their methods of publication. Different artists focus on the variety of applications an online space 
    offers, and what it means to them and to their audience in terms of connection; displays, interactions, and 
    other elements are conjoined to convey unique meanings. </p>

A website by Chia Amisola presenting comments from songs on Youtube. This display focuses on the intimate 
moments strangers share in an unassuming online space, especially one where there is really no terms of 
“growth” – comments sections of other peoples’ videos. It shares experiences people want to say without 
much expectation for attention. </p>

A webzine (a digital magazine) made by students for the Digital Love Languages class of Summer 2020, 
featuring a collection of media and works. This is an intimate depiction of the individual human experience, 
of creative labor, consciousness, and connection with people. The site captures the fluidity and abstraction 
of feeling, contained in a virtual space.</p>
