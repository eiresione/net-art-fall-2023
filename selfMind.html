<div class="selfAware">
    self awareness is dependent on feedback/perceptions of you from other people,
    to be self-aware is to look outward... dialogue with others
    self-consciousness is the recognition of self, it is the response to feedback/
    perceptions from other people which leads to self-justification and blocking 
    growth... to be self-conscious is to look inward and shut out others
    self-talk, monologues
    <a href="https://eiresione.github.io/net-art-fall-2023/soul.html">self-awareness exists to fuel discovery in order to connect better with people,
    it is a bridge from self to others </a>
