    <h1><strong>
        Interpersonal Instances Online </strong></h1>
    <p>Social experiences and their subsequent emotional consequences long reigned as topics of 
    literature and art. Now they take form in the online world in all corners of the internet, existing in passion projects,
    forum discussions, comments sections, articles, and so on. What exists online can be visited by anyone, 
    anytime, granting a new set of interactions with expressions of human connection. </p>
    
    <p>Universal love, friendship, 
    romance, or the many other forms of relationships we live through speak to the complexity that exists between 
    each one of us, albeit most of the time it is invisible. Social interconnection is not so easily contained, 
    however. We seek to immortalize our social lives and our reactions to them in our creations. The internet
    serves as a space to extend our thoughts and our work, but it can display what exists between us; all the emotions
    and complexities which keeps humanity functioning.</p>

  <p>  This exhibition serves to highlight works on interpersonal attachment, or means of exploring the metaphorical 
    space between people. In other words, projects centered on human connection, presented online. The following 
    net artworks feature exploration of the nature of relationships and their translations to the digital world, 
    as well as their methods of publication. Different artists focus on the variety of applications an online space 
    offers, and what it means to them and to their audience in terms of connection; displays, interactions, and 
    other elements are conjoined to convey unique meanings. </p>

  <h1><strong>Do You Hear the Sound of Love?</strong></h1></a>
<p>A website by Chia Amisola presenting comments from songs on Youtube. This display focuses on the intimate 
moments strangers share in an unassuming online space, especially one where there is really no terms of 
“growth” – comments sections of other peoples’ videos. It shares experiences people want to say without 
much expectation for attention. </p>

of feeling, contained in a virtual space.</p>
