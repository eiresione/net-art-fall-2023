<body><br><b>We are who we are not and life is swift and sad. </b></br>
  <br> The sound of waves at night is a nocturnal sound, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and how many have heard it&nbsp; 
             in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; own &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;soul </br>
  <br>like the constant hope breaking in the dark in a dull thud of dense foam!</br> 
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What tears were shed by those who failed, 
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what tears were spent by those who reached their goal! </br>
  <br>In my stroll by the sea, all this came to me like the secrets of the night, the whispered confidences of the 
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abyss. </br>
  <br> How many we are, how many of those selves we deceive! </br>
 <br> What seas break in us, in the night of our being, along beaches that we only sense in the full flood of our emotion!</br>
  <br></br>
  
  <ol>What we lost,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what we should have loved, 
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what we got and were, by mistake, contented with, 
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what we loved and lost,
                &nbsp;&nbsp;  and, once lost, 
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    saw that we had not loved but loved it still just because we had lost it;</ol>
            <ul>what we believed we thought when we felt something; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what we believed to be an emotion and was in fact only a memory; </ul>
     <br></br>
  <ul> and, as I walked, the whole sea came rolling in, </ul>
     <ul> cool and clamorous, </ul>
     <ul> from the deepest reaches of the dark, 
      to etch itself delicately along the sandsâ€¦</ul>
  <br></br>
<p> Who knows what he thinks or what he desires? </p>
  <p>Who knows what meaning he really has for himself?</p> 
    <p>How many things are suggested to us by music and how comforting to know those things can never be! </p>
  <br></br>
      
<br>How many things the night recalls and how we weep for them though they never were! </br>
      <p>Like a voice unleashed from the long peaceful line of the sea, </p>
        <ol>the wave arches, crashes and dies,</ol>
        <p>leaving behind the sound of its waters licking the invisible shore.</p>
<br></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <h2>How I die if I allow myself to feel for all things!</h2>
  <p class="indent">How much I feel if I let myself drift, incorporeal and human, my heart quiet as a beach, and, in the night in which we live,</p>
    <p class="indent">in my endless nocturnal walk along its shore, the sea of all things beats loud and mocking, then grows calm.</p>
<br></br>
