<body><b>We are who we are not and life is swift and sad. </b>
  <br> The sound of waves at night is a nocturnal sound, and how many have heard it in their own soul like the constant hope breaking in the dark in a dull thud of dense foam! What tears were shed by those who failed, what tears were spent by those who reached their goal! In my stroll by the sea, all this came to me like the secrets of the night, the whispered confidences of the abyss. 
  <br> How many we are, how many of those selves we deceive! What seas break in us, in the night of our being, along beaches that we only sense in the full flood of our emotion!
  <ol>What we lost, 
    what we should have loved, 
    what we got and were, 
    by mistake, 
    contented with, 
    what we loved and lost, 
    and, once lost, 
    saw that we had not loved but loved it still just because we had lost it;</ol>
    <ul>what we believed we thought when we felt something; 
      what we believed to be an emotion and was in fact only a memory; 
      and, as I walked, the whole sea came rolling in, 
      cool and clamorous, 
      from the deepest reaches of the dark, 
      to etch itself delicately along the sands…</ul>
<br> Who knows what he thinks or what he desires? Who knows what meaning he really has for himself? How many things are suggested to us by music and how comforting to know those things can never be! How many things the night recalls and how we weep for them though they never were! Like a voice unleashed from the long peaceful line of the sea, the wave arches, crashes and dies, leaving behind the sound of its waters licking the invisible shore.

&nbsp; How I die if I allow myself to feel for all things! 
  <p>How much I feel if I let myself drift, incorporeal and human, my heart quiet as a beach, and, in the night in which we live, in my endless nocturnal walk along its shore, the sea of all things beats loud and mocking, then grows calm.</p>
