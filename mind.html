    the problem is that I expected more and the gritty part of the problem is that I know "more" doesn't exist, 
    because that would only happen if we assume the bond between us is stronger than it is. 
    do you care or is this just formality? 

 humanity would not exist without community and interdependence

where do all your little thoughts go? when you're making food when you talk to your sibling when you watch 
a really good show when you read a good book when you see something and you have to 
have to have to get it out Now where does it Go
you internalize it? you mean to tell me you keep it in?

here is what I am picturing:
the low branches of cherry blossom trees, trunks split so that i could wedge my foot between them and push myself up. the tree is easy to shake and the petals fall on you. each one that touches you is kissing your skin, wishing you a pleasant emotion in the far future when you will need it most.

our fingertips, frozen and stiff, touching one anothers at a bus stop. our nails are blunt and it's easier to keep them in this manner. I feel your hand to check for spots of skin that have dried from the wintertime air. 

I lose time every day. we are busy, naturally, we collectively lose multitudes of it. 
when I am free for a little bit, and when you are ready for me, I engulf you with all the love I can spare; 
I make infinity in a minute.

I will turn the thermostat higher in the mornings, so you never wake with cold limbs. 
I will not rest on the nights you cannot sleep through. 

I will learn from you, yearn for you. Love you meaninglessly, love you intentionally. 

here is what I am picturing:
sunsets at a lake high in the mountains, where we drive up close to the clouds and the world below us is foggy with the atmosphere. if only icarus could see me now, how close to the sun I'd be, right beside you in a lake whose waters glow underneath your chin.

I want you to watch flowers die with me. they would be there only for a season, 
and for that fleeting moment I would rejoice all throughout. 
next season i will make you come to the garden and seperate the soil with me all the same. 
there would be bulbs in some places - the flowers that stay beneath the frost when it appears - they will come next season, too, and you will not have to dig for them. I hope you like tulips. I do not, but they stay.



I am enamored and have been in love with the concept of nonexistence after death

<a href="https://eiresione.github.io/net-art-fall-2023/selfMind.html">as someone dear to me said,
death better not curse me with consciousness </a>

I want my life to be finite, completely belonging to me

<div class="content">
  <p> cant you settle down with me? I'll cut you pomegranate and you can mix potions on a windowsill littered with hanging flowers. I'll love you like the sun loves the earth. We can be boundless and beautiful, together, intertwined in the brush of hanging humidity. Wouldnt you like that? Wouldnt you stay with me, forget the dim lights of mansions and beautiful people, and stay? I know its asking too much and I know its selfish. I want you more than the ocean when it pulls at the sand and rocks of beaches. The hunger I have for you makes me dread being alive but I want you so. What will I do? Tell me. You're smarter than me. 
    I cant promise you many things, though I wish I could. I would give you diamonds and kingdoms far beyond what we've seen but I'm no conqueror or king. I'm just longing. 
    I'm just lonely even though I'm with you. Do you see now, how horrible I am, wanting you in ways you will not let yourself be taken? Can't you come over here for a minute and tell me what I want to hear, and kill me already? Or is this my responsibility to hold, this heavy burden, pining for you and gripping my fists when I should be gripping your hair and loving you?
    That's too much. That's too much for you and for me. Maybe I'm just lonely, and I want you to make me less lonely because you are the only one who cares for me. And that's terrible too, isnt it? 
    Please, give me answers, though you do not understand me.</p>

        Perhaps, then, it is just her. Hopeless in understanding the complexity of others, 
        and choosing to run circles around them, as if she could catch up to their speed and 
        mingle her way in between the hushed voices in their heads, where they talk to themselves about the world.
        
        What frightens her is thoughts. What claws at her own skin is the mangled hems of 
        dresses adorned by the egos of people greater than her. They are right, to strangle her innate longings, 
        those light wishes that come to her in maladaptive daydreams. 
        She is incompetent to complete them. It is easier to kill impulses than to light 
        a fire beneath them to make them rise in the smoke.
