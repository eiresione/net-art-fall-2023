        self awareness is dependent on feedback/perceptions of you from other people,
        to be self-aware is to look outward... dialogue with others
        self-consciousness is the recognition of self, it is the response to feedback/
        perceptions from other people which leads to self-justification and blocking 
        growth... to be self-conscious is to look inward and shut out others
        self-talk, monologues
        self-awareness exists to fuel discovery in order to connect better with people,
        it is a bridge from self to others
