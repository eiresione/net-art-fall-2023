        I was birthed from ash and blinded by the thousand suns in a corner of the universe 
        that forever will exist but does not matter. I have lived a childhood of headaches 
        and scraped knees like every other kid, all bloodied and bruised when they come home 
        from tumbling in the pebbles of cracked streets.

  In the dirt-filled spots behind my home, I crouched to pour water into a motley of tiny branches. 
It was there that mud became my best friend only to make my skin grubby, and the pinecones and rocks lead me astray 
into 
tiny worlds 
I could manage, I could love, because I was terribly alone but I did not feel it when ants were crawling 
up my shoes. Every day I was bringing home the memories of a dirty backyard, scathed in water. But 
the summer days were hot, the sun killed me, and I have not seen anything at all.

I've felt all the hazy orange winter evenings when the snow would fall thick and wet my hands, 
I've felt the leaves of autumn break apart beneath me and I've felt it over and over, as if the 
world revolved only around subliminal things like that. Because I was invested, wholeheartedly, 
in the care of the rough, woody hands of local trees and the ants that would drown in the rivers 
of hose water, and the ugly little flowers my mother loved, and the fireflies, the rug beneath my bed, 
the books I carried and the ghosts of the people that dared not walk the streets when I was late to school. 

I thought, foolishly, how short the classes are. How home waited for me a couple blocks down, 
so when the proper hour of the afternoon hit I could walk there to taste the sweet texture of figs 
from a dying tree. Home was where my grandmother would invite me to talk with open arms and I would 
run across pavement to chlorinated water in the sweaty days, where I could trace dinosaurs and crack 
crayons with my fists where nothing, nothing, stood between me and the swings and slides and bars of 
a little patch of the world I treasured.

  How dare the sun rip away my love. Ignorance is bliss and I scream and I cry it because my mind is 
foggy when it comes to the important things but I will forever remember my mistakes and they will 
haunt me until time takes me away. Ignorance is bliss because I've not realized the stares and the 
grimaces until they were wired permanently on peoples faces, I have not seen the hatred nor have I 
heard the talking and the lies and the blatant egoism of people who ripped my soul away from me until 
I was spitting blood and wishing I was dead because who wants me here, when I hold all this wasted carbon, 
and who wants me here when I am best used for a conversation I am not apart of? Because I am a fleeting moment 
and I am entertainment for those who make crowns out of souls.

How dare the thousand suns birth me blind and give me vision then, when I've walked proudly with only 
the graze of my fingertips against a dark world. When I did not need light to know what was in front of me.

But time will drag the bastards born with me in this shameful little universe down, and we will all 
rot with the earthworms that squirmed in the tiny palm of my soft hand, before it calloused with the 
wear of writing; because crowns of souls are lesser than the thousand suns that birthed me, and that 
light doesnt even matter at all. We stand on one line in death, because life gives unequal pedestals 
and lets those who are lucky touch the soft fabric of the heavens, but death is eternal and hoards and 
hoards and hoards and makes sure we fully understand that we are all nothing.

And back to the universe we go.
